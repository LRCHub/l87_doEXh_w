[00:00.08] So the taxis never stop
[00:02.36] The girls think you're a flop
[00:04.23] You're wet and cold, you're getting old
[00:06.23] Your confidence is shot (it's true)
[00:23.73] 
[00:08.54] When people look at you
[00:10.57] They seem to look straight through
[00:12.55] Or like you're something brown
[00:14.19] They found upon the bottom of their shoe
[00:17.39] (Have you been following me?)
[00:31.89] 
[00:18.33] But this should lift the gloom
[00:20.06] My giraffe milk macaroon
[00:22.20] Just take a chance and you'll be dancing
[00:24.47] To a different tune
[00:33.97] 
[00:26.28] Goodbye to feeling small
[00:28.31] And frightened of it all
[00:30.27] Just eat a few of these
[00:31.70] And you'll be feeling ten feet tall
[00:49.20] 
[00:36.25] Well, there's chocolate
[00:40.25] And there's chocolate
[00:42.15] Only Wonka's makes your confidence sky-rocke-let
[00:46.37] Put your hand into your pocke-let
[00:48.37] Get yourself some Wonka chocolate!
[01:05.37] 
[00:50.34] Madam, just one kiss?
[00:52.67] Yes, please!
[00:53.87] You've never had chocolate like this
[00:57.08] No, we've never had chocolate like this
[01:16.58] 
[01:09.83] Have you tried his new one? (No)
[01:11.44] Oh, you've got to have a go
[01:13.58] Just pop one in and everything
[01:15.36] Becomes a Broadway Show
[01:26.86] 
[01:18.82] The news that makes you gasp
[01:20.57] The jokes that make you laugh
[01:22.32] All that you say and do all day will be choreographed
[01:48.82] 
[01:27.26] Lost your hair, can't think where
[01:28.90] Feeling fairly bare up there
[01:30.67] Don't despair, I come prepared
[01:32.23] Behold my hair repair éclair
[01:46.23] 
[01:34.36] It's made from ground vanilla
[01:36.06] From the markets of Manila
[01:37.81] Take heed, eat more than three and you'll end up like a gorilla
[02:09.31] 
[01:43.29] Well, there's chocolate
[01:45.43] And there's chocolate
[01:47.22] Only Wonka's makes you rock around the clock-elet
[01:53.27] Put your hand into your pocke-let! Get yourself
[02:16.77] 
[01:55.72] Oh, put a sock in it
[01:56.83] Make sure they're all frisked (uh!)
[01:59.94] Have you ever had chocolate like this?
[02:18.94] 
[02:05.43] I've never had chocolate like this
[02:11.00] (Never had chocolate)
[02:12.19] (Never had chocolate like this)
[02:27.69] 
[02:16.49] Well, there's literate, and illiterate
[02:20.26] Can you tell me what this word is? (Not a bit of it)
[02:24.26] Well, that's a vowel and that's a consonant
[02:45.76] 
[02:26.43] What's that now? You're talking nonsense
[02:28.25] I should call it quits
[02:31.64] But you've never sold chocolate like this
[02:52.14] 
[02:36.62] Well, there's chocolate
[02:37.98] (I understand that)
[02:38.88] And there's chocolate, totally true
[02:40.91] Only Wonka drives a hole right through our profi-lets (yes)
[03:10.41] 
[02:43.84] But what I'm trying to tell you is that
[02:45.10] If we don't get on top of this (uh-huh)
[02:47.07] We'll go bust
[02:47.86] Choc-apocalypse!
[02:55.86] 
[02:48.87] We'll cease to exist
[02:51.37] But fellas, you've never had chocolate like this
[02:55.33] No! We've never had chocolate like this
[03:14.83] 
[03:01.10] Well, there's chocolate (well, there's chocolate)
[03:02.23] And there's chocolate (and there's chocolate)
[03:04.40] Only mine will find you buying wedding frocke-lets
[03:29.40] 
[03:09.02] We have just tied the knot
[03:10.73] And it's all because of Wonka's chocolate
[03:12.94] Off to a life of bliss
[03:23.94] 
[03:16.64] You've never had chocolate like this
[03:19.61] No, we've never had chocolate like this
[03:23.56] Have you ever had chocolate like this?
[03:27.38] No, we've never had chocolate, no
[03:31.76] We've never had chocolate like this
